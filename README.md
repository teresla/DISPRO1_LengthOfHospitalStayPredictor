# DISPRO1_LengthOfHospitalStayPredictor

The project aims to develop a Hospital Stay Duration Predictor using supervised learning regression techniques. Accurately predicting the length of a patient's hospital stay is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and improving patient care within healthcare institutions.
Primarily we will focus on the research question: 
•	How can we best predict a patient's hospital stay duration using supervised learning regression?

RELEVANCE
The work addresses critical challenges in healthcare, including resource optimization and improved patient care. In the coming years, the impact of accurate hospital stay duration predictions could include:
•	Resource Efficiency: Hospitals can efficiently allocate resources such as beds, and equipment, reducing operational costs and enhancing overall healthcare delivery.
•	Patient Satisfaction: Predicting and managing hospital stays effectively can lead to better patient experiences and outcomes, ultimately improving patient satisfaction and retention.
•	Staff Contentment: Anticipating hospital stays in advance allows for better shift planning, contributing to happier employees and enhancing overall healthcare operations.
